Welcome! This is a Pokedex that consumes data from the [PokeApi: ](https://pokeapi.co/).

Please clone the repository and don't forget execute the next command line to download the dependencies into the project:

```
yarn install
```

The next step is up this UI. The setting for the port is 3001, but you can change it in vite.config.js

```
yarn dev
```

After that, go to:

```
http://localhost:3001
```
